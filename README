This is RecordSize plugin for GNU C++ compiler

Its aim is to detect cases where we can save some space by reorganizing fields
within record.

Usage:

g++ -fplugin=recordsize.so some_cpp_source

By default plugin will emit a warning for records for which its minimal size
estimation is less then actual record size. Template instantiations are ignored.

You can tweak plugin behavior using command line switches:

-fplugin-arg-recordsize-process-templates - enables template instantiations
  processing.

-fplugin-arg-recordsize-print-layout - print record layout. That allows to see
  which sizes/offsets/alignments are used by each field of reported records.

-fplugin-arg-recordsize-print-all - print record layout for all (even not
  missized) records we process.

-fplugin-arg-recordsize-dumpfile=filename - dump record information to given
  file. Dump file is appended with new record information on each next GCC
  invocation. This especially useful if you modify CXXFLAGS for some large
  project. After build is finished you can use separate tool report-recordsize
  and build report for whole project.
  WARNING: There is no source file updates tracking, so you have to remove dump
  after you've modified sources. Otherwise record data won't be updated and
  you'll see outdated output!
